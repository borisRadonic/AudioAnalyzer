The FFT algorithm used is derived from Numerical Recipes in C, published by Cambridge University Press.

The following window functions have been implemented:
    Hamming
    Flat Top
    Hann
    Bartlett-Hann
    Blackman
    Blackman-Harris
    Nuttall
    Blackman-Nuttall
    Parzen
    Triangular
    Welch

The best results were achieved with the Flat Top window.
